### Coding Challenges

##### What is this?

- This repo contains a bunch of short to medium coding challenges that can be used to solidify the understanding of any programming language. All of the challenges have been taken from [here](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/).

##### Why am I doing these challenges?

I have decided to learn a new programming language [Go](https://go.dev/). I will be using these challenges for practice.
